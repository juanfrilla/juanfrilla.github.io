Static disassembler for the **BET365 VM** that transforms encoded VM bytecode into a human-readable representation of its instructions.

## Reverse Engineering Approach

We start from the assumption that a JavaScript Virtual Machine (JSVM) can be reduced to a structure similar to the following and nothing here is invented; all the information we needed was obtained through dynamic analysis (debugging directly in the browser the javascript code) or static analysis (reading the original JavaScript source code):

```javascript
var base64Bytecode = "bigStringBase64Encoded...";

function VM(bytecode) {
    var pc = 0;

    while (true) {
        var opcode = bytecode[pc++];

        switch (opcode) {
            case 0:
                // handler 0 logic ...

            case 1:
                // handler 1 logic ...

            case 2:
                // handler 2 logic ...

            // rest of the handlers logic ...
        }
    }
}

function decoder(base64Bytecode) {
    return [];
}

var bytecode = decoder(base64Bytecode);

VM(bytecode);
```

The exact implementation will vary between JSVMs, but the general architecture is often based on a **bytecode decoder**, a **program counter (`pc`)**, and an **interpreter loop** that dispatches instructions according to their opcode.

### Step 1 — Identify the Bytecode Decoder

The first step is to identify the function responsible for decoding the embedded Base64 bytecode.

The goal is to determine:

* Where the Base64 string is decoded.
* What data structure is produced by the decoder.
* Whether the result is an `Array`, `Uint8Array`, or another buffer-like structure.
* The length and contents of the resulting bytecode.
* Where the decoded bytecode is passed to the VM.

Conceptually:

```text
Base64 string
      ↓
   decoder()
      ↓
 decoded bytecode
      ↓
    VM()
```

### Step 2 — Identify the Program Counter

Once the decoded bytecode is located, the next step is to identify the VM's **program counter (`pc`)**.

A typical interpreter fetches an opcode using a pattern such as:

```javascript
var opcode = bytecode[pc++];
```

The `pc` determines which byte is currently being interpreted and how the VM advances through the bytecode.

### Step 3 — Identify the Opcodes
Once the decoder and the program counter (pc) have been located, the next step is to identify all the opcodes and their corresponding handlers.

In the original client-side VM, opcodes are not dispatched through a switch statement. Instead, the VM uses a dispatch table: an array of functions indexed by the numeric opcode. Each entry in the array is the handler for that opcode.

For example, the original code looks like this:

```javascript
_0xcb42bb[237] = function () {
  var _0x1c5c8f = _0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++];
  var _0x33cf58 =
    (_0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++] << 24) |
    (_0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++] << 16) |
    (_0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++] << 8) |
    _0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++];
  if (_0x1ad981[_0x1c5c8f]) {
    _0x1ad981[141] = _0x33cf58;
  }
};

_0xcb42bb[73] = function () {
  var _0x4a55e6 =
    (_0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++] << 24) |
    (_0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++] << 16) |
    (_0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++] << 8) |
    _0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++];
  _0x1ad981[141] = _0x4a55e6;
};

_0xcb42bb[83] = function () {
  var _0x456c57 = _0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++];
  var _0x432349 =
    (_0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++] << 24) |
    (_0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++] << 16) |
    (_0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++] << 8) |
    _0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++];
  if (!_0x1ad981[_0x456c57]) {
    _0x1ad981[141] = _0x432349;
  }
};
```
Where:

- _0xcb42bb is the dispatch table (array of handler functions).
- _0x555150 is the decoded bytecode buffer.
- _0x1ad981[141] is the program counter (pc).
- _0x1ad981 is the register array (VM state).

This means the VM's main loop is conceptually:

```javascript
while (true) {
  var opcode = bytecode[pc++];
  dispatchTable[opcode]();   // execute the handler for this opcode
}
```
Since working with numeric indices into an array of anonymous functions is hard to read, we converted the dispatch table into a switch statement, mapping each numeric opcode to a named case:

```javascript
switch (opcode) {
  case 73:  // JMP
  case 83:  // JMP_IF_FALSE
  case 237: // JMP_IF_TRUE
  case 144: // MOV
  case 80:  // NEW
  case 67:  // CLOSURE
  case 188: // CALL_FUNC
  case 172: // GETPROP
  case 56:  // SETPROP
  // ...
}
```
This conversion does not change the semantics — it is purely a readability improvement. Each case corresponds exactly to one entry in the original dispatch table.

This process produces the opcode table where each entry records:

- The address after the execution of the handler
- A human-readable mnemonic (e.g., MOV, JMP, CALL_FUNC).
- The handler logic (what the VM does when executing that opcode).
- The number and type of operands it consumes.

e.g
```javascript
case 93: {
    var dst = bytecode[state.pc++];
    var src1 = bytecode[state.pc++];
    var src2 = bytecode[state.pc++];
    instructions.push(`[ ${state.pc} ] ADD R${dst} = R${src1} + R${src2}`);
    break;
}
```

Some opcodes may appear duplicated or share similar names (e.g., LESS THAN for both 77 and 244).


### Step 4 — Determine Operand Consumption

For every opcode handler, we need to determine exactly how many bytes are consumed from the bytecode, also debugging.

For example:

```javascript
    _0xcb42bb[144] = function () {
      var _0xff4c85 = _0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++];
      var _0x1d616e = _0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++];
      _0x1d616e = _0x1ad981[_0x1d616e];
      _0x1ad981[_0xff4c85] = _0x1d616e;
    };
```

This tells us that opcode `144` has the following bytecode layout:

```text
[opcode] [dst] [src]
```

and consumes:

```text
1 opcode byte (inside the while true)
2 operand bytes (inside the handler)
----------------
3 bytes total
```


To read multi-byte operands, we use the readInt32 function, which reads a 32-bit big-endian integer from the bytecode and advances the program counter:

```javascript
function readInt32(bytecode, state) {
  return (
    (bytecode[state.pc++] << 24) |
    (bytecode[state.pc++] << 16) |
    (bytecode[state.pc++] << 8) |
    bytecode[state.pc++]
  );
}
```
This function is used by opcodes such as 67 (CLOSURE), 73 (JMP), 83 (JMP_IF_FALSE), and many others that contain 32-bit addresses or integers.


```javascript
    _0xcb42bb[73] = function () {
      var _0x4a55e6 =
        (_0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++] << 24) |
        (_0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++] << 16) |
        (_0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++] << 8) |
        _0x555150[_0x1ad981[141]++];
      _0x1ad981[141] = _0x4a55e6;
    };
```


All of this information was extracted directly from the client-side code of the VM. Nothing was invented; every operand layout and consumption rule was derived by debugging the actual execution and reading the original implementation.


### Step 5 — Build the Disassembler

Once the operand layout of each opcode is understood, we can reconstruct the bytecode instruction set and implement a static disassembler.

The process becomes:

```text
Base64 bytecode
       ↓
   Decoder analysis
       ↓
   Identify VM loop
       ↓
   Identify PC
       ↓
   Identify opcodes
       ↓
   Determine operand layout
       ↓
   Determine instruction semantics
       ↓
    Disassembler
```

The key objective is to build a mapping between the raw bytecode representation and a human-readable instruction representation:

```text
Raw bytecode:

[144] [5] [12]

        ↓

Disassembly:

[0x0000] MOV R5, R12
```

By recovering the operand consumption and semantics of each opcode, the VM's bytecode can be progressively transformed from a raw binary representation into a readable instruction stream suitable for static analysis and further reverse engineering.
